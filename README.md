## _Why_?

Security of people's data stored in IT systems is _critical_ for _every_ organization.

> **Note**: We have a _general_ "introductory" tutorial:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security <br />
if you just need some plain-english background, tips & tools for your team!

#### Our _purpose_ for creating `this` repo is to:

+ ensure that both _we_ (_the AMI team_) and our _stakeholders_
(_people who use our app(s) for their business-critical or personal information_)
have the _confidence_ in our IT systems/process.
+ have a _checklist_ we can follow in the case of
  + a joiner/leaver (_what access should someone joining our team be granted?_)
  + specific scenario such as a lost/stolen device
  + breach of trust by a person with privileged access AKA "_privacy incident_"
  + other "_scenarios_" such as natural disaster.
+ have all documentation in place so that we can _apply_ for **ISO 27001** certification
 (_and thus be able to service bigger Organizations which have higher InfoSec requirements_)

## _What_?

The [**ISO 27001:2013 _Standard_**](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001) defines requirements for the **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** of information systems.

It's meant to _help_ people (_in organizations_)
think about and implement "_controls_" which improve IT security.

This repository is _our_ ***implementation*** of the "controls"
corresponding (_policy/procedure_) documentation required to
_ensure_ that the control is _unambiguous_ to everyone in our team/community!

> For comprehensive details about ISO/IEC 27001:2013 see:
http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27001.html


## _Who_?

***All people*** in the organization who have contact with Information Technology
or data should be given training on IT security. There's no excuse for "_naivety_"
or "_ignorance_" and "_professional negligence_" with security will _not_ be _tollerated_.

None of the "_concepts_" are "_complicated_" if you break them down into simple steps.

### What "_qualifies_" us...?

You may be reading this thinking _what_ qualifies DWYL to prepare our own
Information Security Processes/Procedures...?

While we do not
([_yet!_](https://github.com/dwyl/ISO27001-2013/issues/))
have a _person_ "_on staff_" who is "_certified_" to "_audit_" our controls/processes,
we do have a [_co-founder_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelsonic)
who put in the time/effort to read all the books/standards and work as an
"Enterprise Risk Consultant" for long enough to know _exactly_ how to implement
the controls/processes. "_All_" we need to be "_certified_" is to
submit an application to the ISO organization.
see: https://github.com/LaGuer/ISO27001-2013/issues/



## _How_?

Even though ISO 27001 is a "_standard_", _annoyingly_ it is **not _free_**, instead we have to _pay_ to download it! It [costs **CHF 118**](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54534) (_£92 at the time of writing_).

### Controls

Once you _read_ through the PDF you _should_ be able to understand
all the controls we have implemented:
